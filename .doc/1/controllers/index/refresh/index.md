# Refresh

When writing or deleting documents in Kuzzle, the update needs to be indexed before being available in search results.

:::info
A refresh operation comes with some performance costs.

From [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/docs-refresh.html):
> "While a refresh is much lighter than a commit, it still has a performance cost. A manual refresh can be useful when writing tests, but donâ€™t do a manual refresh every time you index a document in production; it will hurt your performance. Instead, your application needs to be aware of the near real-time nature of Elasticsearch and make allowances for it."
